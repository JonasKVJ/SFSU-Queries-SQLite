# SFSU-Queries
Warning: Opening the queries might take a while, since they are in pdf format 

See Queries_SQL&SQLite.pdf for an example of simple queries written in SQL using SQLite, as part of an Introduction to Databases course at San Francisco State University, Fall 2017. 
The course involved the following principles: ER diagrams, queries in SQL, queries in the ACID-compliant RDBMS SQLite, indexes, hashing, queries using SQL in a C program and transactions.
